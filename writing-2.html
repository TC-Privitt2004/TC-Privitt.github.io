			<p>Every day I have nightmares.<br>
			Ones that gives even those without a care in the world,<br>
			fear.
			<br>
			<br>	
				The overwhelming fear<br>
			that, regardless of what they do,<br>
			Death draws near.<br>
			Now they only dream.<br><br>
				They dream<br>
			of a better future,<br>
			however impossible it may seem.<br>
			But, as time passes,<br>
			its becoming clear <br>
			that the dream is fleeting.<br><br>
				The dream is fleeting,<br>
			because they are losing their feeling on the inside.<br>
			They feel their life is not worth completing.<br><br>
				When they attempt to take life,<br>
			they may miss,<br>
			but they might plunge the knife into their chest.<br>
			If so, the pain will finally be released.<br><br>
				<em>Finally,<br>
			the pain is gone.</em>

<th><div id="Poemtit2"><p><em>Just a Tingle</em></p><div id=Poem2>
<p>Ever constant numbness comes over me,</p>
<p>washing over all other feelings.</p>
<p>I wish i could get rid of it and finally be free,</p>
<p>and be able to start healing.</p>
<br>
<p>Feel nothing</p>
<p>ever.</p>
<p>Experience nothing</p>
<p>ever.</p>
<p>Know nothing</p>
<p>ever.</p>
<br>
<p>I wish I could feel something</p>
<p>even just a tingle</p>
<p>a little sliver</p>
<p>of emotion.</p>
<br>
<p>Always in the way</p>
<p>never a help</p>
<p>always a burden</p>
<p>making things worse than they should be</p>
<br>
<p>End it here.</p>
<p>Blade to throat.</p>
<p>Slice it up.</p>
<p>Then I might feel something.</p>
