			<p>Every day I have nightmares.<br>
			Ones that gives even those without a care in the world,<br>
			fear.
			<br>
			<br>	
				The overwhelming fear<br>
			that, regardless of what they do,<br>
			Death draws near.<br>
			Now they only dream.<br><br>
				They dream<br>
			of a better future,<br>
			however impossible it may seem.<br>
			But, as time passes,<br>
			its becoming clear <br>
			that the dream is fleeting.<br><br>
				The dream is fleeting,<br>
			because they are losing their feeling on the inside.<br>
			They feel their life is not worth completing.<br><br>
				When they attempt to take life,<br>
			they may miss,<br>
			but they might plunge the knife into their chest.<br>
			If so, the pain will finally be released.<br><br>
				<em>Finally,<br>
			the pain is gone.</em>
